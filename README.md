# lettuce_entertain_you

**copied from LEYE PDF:**
Requirements for this project and where to find them:

● Must be responsive

_tested on multiple sizes of screens- feel free to try on your cell phone. Also verified on google as mobile responsive_

● Must include a navigation bar with at least five links. The links do not need to go anywhere

_there are 3 main links on the nav bar with 3 sublinks under the "menu" option. This will total 6 total links. The Intro Chicago also links back to the home page_

● Must include a footer

_footer is located at the bottom of the page and includes additional links and (fake) legal information_

● Must include a contact form and form must validate using either JavaScript or PHP

_validated using JS - also integrated some HTML5 methods to confirm syntax entered by user. Please confirm these practices by examining index.html and index.js_

**Additional Notes**:

● Feel free to make up content, copy, and color

● Images can include watermarks and can be sourced from anywhere. You do not need to purchase stock photography

● Page should adhere to accessibility guidelines

_Happy to discuss practices further in person but I made sure that everything could be navigated without a mouse, checked for contrast, included alt tags, and made a "skip navigation" feature_

● Brand Logo will be provided
